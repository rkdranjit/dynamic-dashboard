   cd your-project-directory

3. Install Dependencies

   npm install
   This will read the package.json file and install all the necessary packages.

4. Start the Development Server
   Start the application by running:

   npm run dev
   This command will start the development server, usually accessible at http://localhost:5173

5. View the Application
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view your React application running locally.
